JFF : Robot Control using webinterface

Just for fun (not fully tested) personal project.
Started in 2013 ; Tested between two ubuntu machines. 
It remains a lot of works but this is a starting point

Robot moves thanks to DStar algorithm
Theorically robot sensor is available to detect wall.
In this version a bmp file is used to emulate sensor (black pixels are obstacles)


 Use at your own risk!
